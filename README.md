# Machine Learning toy projects
A few short machine learning toy projects
1. The first one is on predicting house prices assuming a linear relationship with their bedrooms, without explicitly revealing the relationship
2. The second one is on handwritten digit detection. I used the MNIST data set to train the model and then imporved it later using a covolution. It will detect a digit between 0-9
3. The third one is on a model that can predict a face as happy or sad.
